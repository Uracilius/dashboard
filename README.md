### Getting Started

This project helps me to develop and keep track of code comments containing `AWAIT`/`TODO`. Follow the steps below to set up the project on your system.

#### Backend Setup

Navigate to the `./backend` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

#### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `./front` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ ng serve -o
```

If you do not have Angular installed, consult the [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) for installation instructions.

#### Script Setup

1. Navigate to the `./scripts` folder.
2. Edit `file_list` by adding the files you want to track on your system.
3. Run `initialize_awaits.bat` by executing it. Ensure you have all the required Python packages installed.

This format uses Markdown code blocks for commands, making them stand out for easier copying and pasting. Including links to relevant documentation (like Angular's setup guide) can also help users who may not have the necessary tools installed.
