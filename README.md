This is a project that will help me develop and keep track of code comments I've written that contain AWAIT/TODO. Currently it's only TODOs but still
Was tired of going around files or using ctrl+shift+f so this is the next best thing.

to start this project ya gotta do these things:

In ./backend folder run: 
$ npm install
$ node index.js

In ./front folder run:
$ npm install
$ ng serve -o if you have angular. consult angular documentation and installation if not.

in ./scripts folder:
edit file_list by adding files you wanna track on your system.
run initialize_awaits.bat by executing it. Make sure you've got all required python packages installed
